## Why Did You Make This?

For fun. I mean, create an alias in the `~/.zshrc`, and you can use it any time in the Terminal, is't that cool?

## How Do I Use This?

Download the Python file in the repository/release, and use it as you want!

Here's some tips:

1. Not for Windows
2. You need to download some extra things to make this works better.
3. I'll be sorry if there's any typo or bad grammars, you know, nobody speak English in my family.
## Why "Not for Windows"?

Because I can't use `\033[0m` or `\e[0m` (the most import thing in these files) as well on Windows platforms, and UNIX commands (`os.system("")`) also didn't work on it.

## What Do I Need?

For the last time I edited the `README.md`, you need these things below:

### Software

1. Python 3.x *(Because I used `f"{}"` format so this is been required)*

### Python Library

1. pyperclip

### Commands

1. figlet

*(Use `brew` or something else to get these)*

## Next Step

- [ ] Confused `hexinde.py`
- [ ] UNIX timestamp computer
- [ ] Base-64 encoder
- [x] Key in `hexinde.py`
- [x] Random chooser
- [x] `ghp.ci` link generator (only release files)
- [x] Hex computer
- [x] Hexadecimal encoder

## At Last

**Hope you enjoy!**
